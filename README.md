# ELPath
An algorithm visualizer.

ELPath is lovingly built using DearPyGui as a basis for its GUI and plotting functions.
This is aimed at providing understandable visualizations of common sorting and pathfinding algorithms.

Development has ceased, but breaking changes to ELPath due to DearPyGui will be noticed and resolved periodically.
