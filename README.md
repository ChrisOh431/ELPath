# ELPath
An algorithm visualizer.

![Pathfinding example (A*)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39662993/129440226-7e59d85e-3e0c-4f14-b602-fe349fd9021c.png)

ELPath is lovingly built using DearPyGui as a basis for its GUI and plotting functions.
This is aimed at providing understandable visualizations of common sorting and pathfinding algorithms.

Visualizations include Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Cocktail Sort, Breadth and Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* Search.

The scale and execution speed of the demonstrations can be modiifed by the user, and a handy maze generation feature is included in the pathfinding to simplify the process of simulating algorithms in identical and fair conditions.

Development has officially ceased, but breaking changes to ELPath due to DearPyGui will be noticed and resolved periodically.

# Dependencies:
DearPyGui v1.5.1

# Do note that I've made a web-based successor to ELPath, particularly for improved sorting demonstrations: [Sorgra.](https://github.com/ChrisOh431/Sorgra)
